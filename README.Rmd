# sk_tda : Skeena Region FLNRORD Telemetry Data Analysis 

### Usage

This repository contains a variety of scripts to analyse radio collared telemetry data. These include data preparation, home range estimations (MCP/Kernel Density), general data summaries and data visualisation/animaltion. 

There are four core scripts that are required for the analysis, they need to be run in order:

##Kernel Density Estimates
  - 01_KDE_Caribou.R  - script to run KDEs
  - 01_KDE_Caribou_detail.R - script to test bandwidth (h parameter) 
  - 00_KDE_analysis_workflow.Rmd  - script to report on KDE methods
  - 00_KDE_analysis_workflow.html - output html document to describe methods

##Minimum Convex Polygon 
  - 01_MCP_Kernal.R

##Mortality Summaaries 
  - 03_mort_summary.R

##Wolf RSF/HR analysis (in draft)  
  - 04.0_Wolf_MCP_Kernel.R - builds minimum convext polys and basic hrefkernel density estimates
  - 04.1_Wolf_AvailablePts.R - draft script to extract random points to be used for RSF analysis 
  - 04.2_Wolf_sp_layer.R - draft sscript to compile spatial layers for RSF 
  - 04.3_Wolf_Logistic_regression.R - draft logistic regression for RSF 
  - 04.4_Wolf_animation.R - html animated graphics to show animal movement! (this is pretty cool!)
  
  
A more complete RSF scripting can also be found here:  [https://github.com/bcgov/clus/blob/master/R/caribou_habitat/04_caribou_habitat_model_telemetry_data_prep_doc.Rmd] compiled by Muhly, T.
